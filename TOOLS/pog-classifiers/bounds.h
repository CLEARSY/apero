/**
   Rudimentary static analysis to bound integer values and set cardinalities.

   Call `eval_bounds` to evaluate conservatively bounds on
   symbols. Currently this only provides bound information for
   sets (their cardinality) and integer constants (their value).
   See types `bounds_t` and `symbol_bounds_t`.
   The result is stored in the `bounds_table_t` passed as a
   parameter.
