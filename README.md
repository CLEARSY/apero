Atelier B oPEn ResOurces

This repository provides resources related to the IDE Atelier B (http://www.atelierb.eu).
Atelier B is an environment for
  * software component development using the B method
  * system modeling using Event-B.

While Atelier B historically used custom data formats and languages, recent developments provide alternative tools using 
XML based formats.

## Formats

### The proof obligation format pog

*pog* is a XML-based format for proof obligations. Its definition is provided in the _pog.xsd_ file as an XML Schema Definition. This definition is documented through annotations directly available in the source file. We use `xsltproc` to generate an HTML version of the documentation.

## Data

### Proof obligation data

We have collected a large number of proof obligations stemming from the application of the B-method and of Event-B for both research and development projects.

The data is provided as a collection of data sets, each data set corresponding to a specific development. Each data set contains files in *pog* format.
